# Bio

I am a research scientist at Amazon. I work on the secret sauce that drives the Go store.

My interests are computer vision, machine learning and health tech.
I received my Master's from Cornell Tech in June 2018 and my Bachelor's from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in June 2015. My major was computer science.

I am an outdoorsy person. I ran the Delhi half marathon and represented my college basketball team.
